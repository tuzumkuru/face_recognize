# Detection tuning
# - detection_model: 'hog' (fast) or 'cnn' (more accurate, slower if dlib built with CNN)
# - upsample_times: how many times to upsample when detecting faces (0..2+). Higher
#   values improve detection for small/far faces but increase CPU/time.
detection_model: hog
upsample_times: 1
# Scale controls how much the frame is downsampled for processing. Increase toward
# 1.0 to keep more detail (better for far faces), decrease (e.g. 0.25) for speed.
